The values that need to change in the vmdk file for the different images are:

RW 3906250 FLAT "<USB_IMAGE_FILE>" 0 (the second number here) 

 - and -

ddb.geometry.cylinders = "3875"

to calculate the size (assuming your raw image is 2000000000 bytes):

    echo $((2000000000 / 512))

To calculate the cylinders:

    echo $((2000000000 / 512 / (16 * 63)))

And update these files in a Xgb.coal.vmdk file.

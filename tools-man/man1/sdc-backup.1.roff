.SH "NAME"
\fBsdc-backup\fR \-\- backup a node running SmartDC zones
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsdc\-backup\fR [\-d directory] [\-s zone]*
.br
\fBsdc\-backup\fR \-S
.br
\fBsdc\-backup\fR \-l
.br
\fBsdc\-backup\fR \-U device
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This utility creates a back up file of the headnode, or of a compute node
that has SmartDC zones deployed on it, which can later be used by
the \fBsdc\-restore\fR command.
The headnode boots off of a USB memory stick, so its important that you
have several backup memory sticks available.  The -U option can be used
to create backup USB memory sticks.
Most of the SmartDC zones are stateless and are not backed up.
The \fBsdc\-backup\fR command saves data from the stateful zones,
along with the current headnode configuration (if run on the headnode).
By default, the backup file is created in /zones, which consumes space in
the node's zpool.  The backup file should be moved off of /zones and onto
stable off\-line storage as soon as possible.

.br
When creating a backup USB memory stick, the master USB memory stick must
also be inserted into the system.  If you are unsure of the device name
for the new USB memory stick, you can find the list of disks on
your system using the \-l option.  If there are only two
USB memory keys plugged into the system, then the device to use with the \-U
option will be the non\-master USB device.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fB\-d directory\fR     Save the backup file in the specified
                 directory.
.
.br
\fB\-l\fR               List the USB disks to determine which
                 to use with the \-U option.
.
.br
\fB\-S\fR               Backup for standby headnode.  This saves
                 the backup onto the master USB key to allow
                 for easy re-creation of the headnode on a
                 standby system.
.
.br
\fB\-s zone\fR          Skip the specified zone. More than one
                 -s option may be used to skip multiple
                 zones.
.
.br
\fB\-U\fR device        Create a bootable USB image on the
                 specified device.  If the device is '-',
                 then a tar archive of the USB key is sent
                 to stdout instead.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

This example creates a backup file in /zones.
.br

.br
# sdc-backup 
.br
Backing up the ca zone
.br
Backing up the capi zone
.br
Backing up the mapi zone
.br
The backup file (size 20M) is /zones/backup-2011-08-23-16-12-34.tgz
.br
Copy or move this file to your backup medium.
.br

.br

.br
This example creates a backup file in /backups and skips backing up the
adminui and riak zones.
.br

.br
# sdc-backup -d /backups -s adminui -s riak
.br
 . . .
.br
The backup file (size 20M) is /backups/backup-2011-08-23-16-12-34.tgz
.br

.br

.br
In this example you mount a USB memory stick which will hold the backup, then
create a backup file on that memory stick.  You would use the device
name of your memory stick for this procedure.
.br

.br
# mkdir /usb_backup
.br
# mount -F pcfs /dev/dsk/c0d1p0:c /usb_backup
.br
# sdc-backup -d /usb_backup
.br
Backing up the adminui zone
.br
Backing up the ca zone
.br
Backing up the capi zone
.br
Backing up the mapi zone
.br
The backup file (size 20M) is /usb_backup/backup-2011-08-23-16-08-01.tgz
.br
# umount /usb_backup
.br

.br

.br
In this example you list the USB disks so you can see which one to use
to create a backup USB memory key.
.br

.br
# sdc-backup -l
.br
c0d0p0 (master)
.br
c0d1p0 
.br

.br

.br
In this example you make a new bootable USB memory stick.
You would use the device name of your new memory stick for this procedure.
.br

.br
# sdc-backup -U c0d1p0

.br
This example creates a backup file of the USB key.
.br

.br
# sdc-backup -U - | gzip >/zones/usbkey.tgz

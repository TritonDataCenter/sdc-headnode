# If operators have enabled IPv6 on the headnode with `external_ip6`, DNS
# lookups will first attempt to resolve AAAA records. The default Triton config
# is to have binder as the first resolver, then external resolvers next. binder
# will respond with NOTIMP to these AAAA requests, which causes tmate to crash
# somewhere in either libevent (3rd party) or libresolv (ours).
# To work around this we will do a DNS lookup against the external resolvers
# specified in SAPI and write that explicitly to the config passed to tmate.
#
# Triton nodes don't usually have IPv6 addresses, but it *is* supported. And
# it's reasonable to assume that IPv6 on external interfaces will become more
# common over time. Ultimately the fix for this will be for binder to return
# REFUSED rather than NOTIMP. Alternatively we could get the
# tmate/libevent/libresolve bug fixed.

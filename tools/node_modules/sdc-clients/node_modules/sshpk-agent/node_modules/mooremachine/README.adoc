# mooremachine

### Short version

This is a framework for organising your async node.js code as Moore
Finite State Machines. FSMs can be easier to reason about and debug than
implicit state kept in callbacks and objects, leading to more correct code.

## Introduction

It's widely known that if you want to sequence some series of asynchronous
actions in node, you should use a library like `vasync` or `async` to do so --
they let you define a series of callbacks to be run in order, like this:

```js
async.series([
    function (cb) { thing.once('something', cb) },
    function (cb) { anotherthing.get(key, function () { cb(null, blah); }); }
]);
```

This lets you define sequential actions with asynchronous functions. However, if
you need more complex logic within this structure, this becomes rapidly
limiting -- it is difficult, for example, to create a loop. You have to
improvise one by nesting some form of loop within a `series` call and a second
layer of callbacks.

Another problem comes if you want to define multiple ways to return from one of
these functions in the async series -- e.g. if there is an error and result
path that are separate:

```js
    function (cb) {
        thing.once('error', cb);
        thing.once('success', function (result) { cb(null, result); });
    }
```

While one such additional path is manageable, things quickly become very
complex.

Instead, let us think of each of the callbacks in such an async sequence as
being states of a finite state machine. With `async.series` we are limited to
defining only edges that progress forwards through the list. If, instead, we
could define whatever edges we like, we could construct conditional logic and
loops across async boundaries. If we had some way to "gang" the callbacks set
up in each state together, they could all be disconnected at state exit and
avoid the need for complex logic to deal with out-of-state events.

This library provides a framework for dealing with just such an async finite
state machine.

### Moore machines

A Moore machine (as opposed to a Mealy machine) is an FSM whose outputs depend
solely on the present state, and not any other inputs. They are considered
to be a simpler approach than the Mealy machine, and easier to reason about.

In our analogy, of course, our state machine does not have distinct outputs
(since really we are using it to run arbitrary code). If we consider the FSM's
"outputs" as the total set of side-effects it has on the program's state,
however, we can interpret a Moore machine as being an FSM where code only runs
on the entry to a new state, and all other events can only serve to cause
state transitions.

## Example

In this example we'll create an FSM called `ThingFSM`. It's a typical network
client, which wants to make a TCP connection to something and talk to it. It
also wants to delay/backoff and retry on failure.

```js
var mod_mooremachine = require('mooremachine');
var mod_util = require('util');
var mod_net = require('net');
var mod_assert = require('assert');

function ThingFSM() {
    /* Some variables we'll use later. */
    this.tf_sock = undefined;
    this.tf_lastError = undefined;
    /* Go to our initial state, 'stopped'. */
    mod_mooremachine.FSM.call(this, 'stopped');
}
mod_util.inherits(ThingFSM, mod_mooremachine.FSM);

/* This function runs when we enter state 'stopped'. */
ThingFSM.prototype.state_stopped = function (S) {
    /*
     * This event handler will go away automatically if we
     * leave the current state.
     */
    S.on(this, 'startAsserted', function () {
        S.gotoState('connecting');
    });
};

/*
 * A common idiom with mooremachine is to have "signal" functions like
 * this one, which are called by something external to the FSM.
 *
 * They assert about the current state and then emit an event on 'this',
 * which triggers a state transition.
 *
 * This pattern ensures that all possible paths out of a given state
 * remain within the state_x() function and can be easily enumerated.
 */
ThingFSM.prototype.start = function () {
    mod_assert.ok(this.isInState('stopped'),
        'ThingFSM must be stopped to call start()');
    this.emit('startAsserted');
};

ThingFSM.prototype.state_connecting = function (S) {
    var self = this;
    /*
     * In this state, we take an action upon state entry (we try to
     * open a new socket connection).
     */
    this.tf_sock = mod_net.connect(...);
    /*
     * And we have two possible ways out of this state. Whichever
     * one happens first will automatically tear down the event
     * handlers for the others, making sure we don't leak any
     * handlers or have unexpected transitions later.
     */
    S.on(this.tf_sock, 'connect', function () {
        S.gotoState('connected');
    });
    S.on(this.tf_sock, 'error', function (err) {
        /*
         * Stash the error so we can do something with it later.
         * It's generally fine to store things on 'self' inside an
         * event handler like this, but *actions* should only be taken
         * upon state entry.
         */
        self.tf_lastError = err;
        S.gotoState('error');
    });
};

ThingFSM.prototype.state_error = function (S) {
    var self = this;
    /* Take action: destroy the socket. */
    if (this.tf_sock !== undefined)
        this.tf_sock.destroy();
    this.tf_sock = undefined;
    /* Print an error, do something, check # of retries... */

    /* Retry the connection in 5 seconds */
    S.timeout(5000, function () {
        S.gotoState('connecting');
    });
};

ThingFSM.prototype.state_connected = function (S) {
    /* ... */
};
```

# API documentation

## FSM

### Inheriting from the FSM class

Implementations of a state machine should inherit from `mod_mooremachine.FSM`,
using `mod_util.inherits`. The only compulsory methods that the subprototype
must implement are the state callbacks.

### `mod_mooremachine.FSM(initialState)`

Constructor. Must be called by the constructor of the subprototype.

Parameters:

 - `initialState`: String, name of the initial state the FSM will enter at
   startup

### `FSM#state_name(stateHandle)`

State entry functions. These run exactly once, at entry to the new state. They
should take any actions associated with the state and set up any callbacks that
can cause transition out of it.

The `stateHandle` argument is a handle giving access to functions that should be
used to set up events that can lead to a state transition. It provides
replacements for `EventEmitter#on`, `setTimeout`, and other mechanisms for async
event handling, which are automatically torn down as soon as the FSM leaves its
current state. This prevents erroneous state transitions from a dangling
callback left behind by a previous state.

It is permissible to call `stateHandle.gotoState()` immediately within the
`state_` function.

Caution should be used when emitting events or making synchronous calls within a
`state_` function -- if it is possible for the handler of the event or callee to
call back into the FSM or emit an event itself that may cause the FSM to
transition, then the results of this occurring synchronously within the state
entry function may be undesirable. It is highly recommended to emit any events
within a `setImmediate()` callback.

Parameters:

 - `stateHandle`, an Object, instance of `mod_mooremachine.FSMStateHandle`

### `FSM#allStateEvent(name)`

Adds an "all-state event". Should be called in the constructor for an FSM
subclass. Any registered all-state event must have a handler registered on it
after any state transition. This allows you to enforce that particular events
must be handled in every state of the FSM.

Parameters:

 - `name`: String, name of the event

### `FSM#getState()`

Returns a String, full current state of the FSM (including sub-state).

### `FSM#isInState(state)`

Tests whether the FSM is in the given state, or any sub-state of it.

Parameters:

 - `state`: String, state to test for

Returns a Boolean.

### Events

FSM derived subclasses provide one EventEmitter event: `'stateChanged'`. This
event fires after every state transition, and has a single argument (a String,
the name of the new state).

It is important to note that `'stateChanged'` always fires on the *next tick
after* the actual transition has occurred. There is no guarantee that the FSM
is still in the state you received an event for.

The `#isInState()` method is useful to check the current state after you have
received a notification.

The reason why `'stateChanged'` emission is not immediate is so that
interacting FSMs cannot re-enter each others' state transition functions,
making it impossible to enforce post-conditions on the transition (e.g.
the checking of allStateEvents).

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

## FSM state handles

### `FSMStateHandle#gotoState(state)`

Transitions the FSM into the given new state. Can only be called once per state
handle.

Parameters:

 - `state`: a String, name of state to transition into

### `FSMStateHandle#on(emitter, event, cb)`

Works like `EventEmitter#on`: equivalent to `emitter.on(event, cb)` but
registers the callback for removal as soon as the FSM moves out of the current
state.

### `FSMStateHandle#timeout(timeoutMs, cb)`

Equivalent to `setTimeout(cb, timeoutMs)`, but registers the timer for clearing
as soon as the FSM moves out of the current state.

Returns the timer handle.

### `FSMStateHandle#callback(cb)`

Wraps an arbitrary callback function in such a way that calling it once the FSM
has left the current state is a no-op.

It's recommended to try to avoid using this if you can (see <<Signal functions>>
below for a possible alternative), but sometimes it is necessary.

Parameters:

 - `cb`: a Function

Returns a Function that takes the same arguments as `cb`.

### `FSMStateHandle#interval(intervalMs, cb)`

Equivalent to `setInterval(cb, intervalMs)`, but registers the timer for
clearing as soon as the FSM moves out of the current state.

Returns the timer handle.

### `FSMStateHandle#validTransitions(possibleStates)`

Should be called from a state entry function. Sets the list of valid transitions
that are possible out of the current state. Any attempt to transition the FSM
out of the current state to a state not on this list (using `gotoState()`) will
throw an error.

Calling `validTransitions` more than once on the same state handle is an error.

Parameters:

 - `possibleStates`: Array of String, names of valid states

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

## Signal functions

One of the key goals of the mooremachine framework is to keep all possible
transitions out of a state together inside the state entry function.

This allows analysis and reasoning about the FSM's movement between states
without having to refer to many parts of the code at once, reducing the
likelihood that possible transitions can go unnoticed.

When FSMs must receive input from outside in order to determine where to
transition to next, the standard method is to do so via event emitter events.

Sometimes, it is desirable for an external component to instead call a method
on the FSM to signal it in some way, instead of emitting an event. This can be
useful to loosen coupling between the components, as well.

When this is desired, the recommended pattern is to use a "signal function":

```js
ThingFSM.prototype.state_stopped = function (S) {
    S.on(this, 'startAsserted', function () {
        S.gotoState('connecting');
    });
};

ThingFSM.prototype.start = function () {
    mod_assert.ok(this.isInState('stopped'),
        'ThingFSM must be stopped to call start()');
    this.emit('startAsserted');
};
```

The two key components of a signal function are:

 * It emits an event on `this`, typically named `verbAsserted`.
 * It must either assert about the current state before emitting, or emit
   only events registered as "all state events".

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

## Sub-states

It is possible to create a "sub-state" with mooremachine FSMs, which "inherits
from" its parent state. For example:

```js
ThingFSM.prototype.state_connected = function (S) {
    S.on(this.tf_sock, 'close', function () {
        S.gotoState('closed');
    });
    if (workAvailable)
        S.gotoState('connected.busy');
    else
        S.gotoState('connected.idle');
};

ThingFSM.prototype.state_connected.busy = function (S) {
    this.tf_sock.ref();
    /* ... */
    S.on(this.tf_work, 'finished', function () {
        S.gotoState('connected');
    });
};

ThingFSM.prototype.state_connected.idle = function (S) {
    this.tf_sock.unref();
    S.on(this, 'workAvailable', function () {
        S.gotoState('connected.busy');
    });
};
```

All event handlers that are set up in the `'connected'` state entry function are
kept when entering `'connected.busy'` or `'connected.idle'`. When changing from
`'connected.busy'` to `'connected.idle'`, the handlers set up in that sub-state
are torn down, but those originating from `'connected'` are kept.

While in a sub-state of `'connected'`, `fsm.isInState('connected')` will
continue to evaluate to `true`. Separate `'stateChanged'` events will be emitted
for each sub-state entered.

Once a handle is used to transition to an unrelated state (e.g. `'closed'` in
the example), all handlers are torn down (from both the parent state and
sub-state) as usual before entering the new state.

## DTrace support

Mooremachine has support for DTrace probes using `dtrace-provider` (and
`libusdt`). The following probes are provided under the
`moorefsm$pid` provider:

 * `create-fsm(char *klass, char *id)` -- fired at the creation of a new FSM
   instance. The `klass` argument contains the string name of the constructor
   of the FSM sub-class. The `id` argument contains a short randomly generated
   string that should be unique to this FSM as long as <~6M instances of this
   class exist in the program (it consists of 64 random bits, base64-encoded,
   so about a 1/1M chance of collision at 6M instances).
 * `transition-start(char *klass, char *id, char *oldState, char *newState)` --
   fired at the beginning of an FSM transitioning to a new state.
 * `transition-end(char *klass, char *id, char *oldState, char *newState)` --
   fired at the end of an FSM transitioning to a new state.

For example:

```
dtrace -Zc 'node thingfsm.js' -n '
    moorefsm$target:::transition-start
    /copyinstr(arg0) == "ThingFSM"/
    {
        printf("%s => %s", copyinstr(arg2), copyinstr(arg3));
    }'
```

When used on the `ThingFSM` above might output:

```
CPU     ID                    FUNCTION:NAME
  4   8216 transition-start:transition-start undefined => stopped
  4   8216 transition-start:transition-start stopped => connecting
  4   8216 transition-start:transition-start connecting => error
```

This will list all the transitions of `ThingFSM` instances.

Another example (as a D-script file):

```
uint64_t timeIn[string];

moorefsm$target:::transition-start
/copyinstr(arg0) == "SocketMgrFSM" && copyinstr(arg2) != "undefined"/
{
    this->id = copyinstr(arg1);
    this->state = copyinstr(arg2);
    this->entryTime = timeIn[this->id];
    this->exitTime = timestamp;
    this->time = (this->exitTime - this->entryTime) / 1000000;
    @timeInState[this->state] = quantize(this->time);
}

moorefsm$target:::transition-end
/copyinstr(arg0) == "SocketMgrFSM"/
{
    this->id = copyinstr(arg1);
    timeIn[this->id] = timestamp;
}
```

This reports on the number of milliseconds spent in each state by
all SocketMgrFSM instances in the process.

The output from this could look like:

```
$ dtrace -Zc 'node test.js' -s script.d

It's generally safe enough to use only the `id` of the FSM as a key in an
associative array or aggregation in DTrace, even when tracing multiple
processes. This only becomes a problem if you expect to have more than a few
million FSMs running at the same time on a system (in which case you can scope
it by pid and class as well as key).
